                Hello my name is Trenton Ringger, and I have a passion for programming.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am working on my computer science degree, and I am loving my classes so far.

            <p>   
                There's a lot that goes on in each of our lives, and I try each and every day to make the people around me and their lives better.
