      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I have an idea for a website that will sweep you off your feet. Everyone likes movies, right? We all have seen the biggest movies every year, but how did we find out about them? The answer is only through trailers, ads, and commercials. But what if there was another way to discover the next big movie coming soon to a theatre near you. I want to create a website that can give a user the experience of entering that movie’s universe. I want the website to have each page styled in the theme of the movie, it will have information that sets the stage for the film, gives some lore to build up excitement for the movie, to build up hype! This is an experience that can build franchises, and make them more unique than any other before it. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Movie fanatics, book lovers, anyone who wants to learn about the next big blockbuster. People will come to this website to learn about new movies. They will come to read articles, lore, and more. They will come to watch trailers, content, and sneak peaks. There is so much to gain be it knowledge, excitement, or hype.</p>  <!-- change this -->
      <p>This website will answer any questions a person may have about the background surrounding a new movie or show coming out. The only necessary skills needed to complete actions on this site is to know how to browse the internet, and how to click on links / play videos / read. They will come to this website because it will be unlike any other, and will be unique.</p>
      <p>This website will have three pages, the homepage will introduce the movie and a general premise, then there will be a page with lore on it, and finally a media page with text explaining some of what the media is about.</p>
