                <p>Widely considered one of the most adept sorcerers on Runeterra, Ryze is an ancient, hard-bitten archmage with an impossibly heavy burden to bear. Armed with immense arcane power and a boundless constitution, he tirelessly hunts for World Runes—fragments of the raw magic that once shaped the world from nothingness. He must retrieve these artifacts before they fall into the wrong hands, for Ryze understands the horrors they could unleash on Runeterra. As Ryze scours Runeterra for fragments of a forgotten past, each step bringing him closer to incredible power—and terrible ruin.</p>

                <p class="p1">Destruction can be wrought upon the earth from the power of world runes. The land was once home to a noble, enlightened civilization, known to its allies and emissaries as the Blessed Isles. However, more than a thousand years ago, an unprecedented magical cataclysm left the barrier between the material and spirit realms in tatters, effectively merging the two… and dooming all living things in an instant.</p>
                <p class="p2"> Ryze believes that sometimes awful things must be done for the world to remain intact. Sometimes those awful things are better than the horrible cataclysm that would otherwise unfold. He tries to stop anyone, and anything from abusing the power of the world runes, and sees it as his task to do this great work.</p>
                <p class="p3">Where once bloomed life, all that lingers is a sense of dread, and the stench of the undead. A malevolent Black Mist permanently shrouds the land, and the earth itself is tainted by dark sorcery. Mortals who dare to venture to these dismal shores will slowly have their life force stolen away from them, which in turn attracts the insatiable, restless spirits of the dead. Those who perish within the Mist are condemned to haunt this nightmarish place for eternity</p>
